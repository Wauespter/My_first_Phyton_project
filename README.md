### What I learned

The challenges overcome were mainly understanding the structure of the Python language and the API mechanism with Gemini AI. Furthermore, the applicability of the project to a very delicate topic in our country, which is the tax burden, further reinforces the benefits that Artificial Intelligence can bring to the general population, providing an understanding of the Laws applied, as well as enabling a harmonious interpretation. between laws that basically deal with the same topics, but which, because they are from different sectors, end up having different interpretations, making it difficult to understand them and the work of public administration to apply them correctly and fairly.



### Continuous development
Constantly overcoming challenges is what motivates me, with each step, with each challenge overcome I feel fulfilled, I continue in search of new horizons.
